                        <ul>
                            <li><strong>Direct URL:</strong> Goes directly to the address.</li>
                             <li><strong>Google Search Fake:</strong> Goes to the address as if it came from a Google Search result, but does not actually go through a Google Search result, nor does the target URL need to exist in any search result. This is for Analytics manipulation; Analytics defines a vast majority of visits sent with this module as "Organic Search".</li>
                             <li><strong>Google Search Direct:</strong> Goes to the address directly from the Google Search Result page containing the target URL. This means you need to specify the SERP URL where the target URL is located in this module. The module starts the task directly from this URL and performs a click action on the search result. Clicks are reflected in Google Search Console. This is the MOST EFFICIENT NAVIGATOR MODULE FOR SERP MANIPULATION purposes. Because unlike the Google Search module, it does not have a long process and provides an advantage by performing maximum Google clicks per unit of time.</li>
                            <li><strong>Google Search:</strong> Finds the site by searching on Google and clicks on it. Clicks are reflected in Google Search Console, however, there is no experience or information suggesting it has an advantage over "Google Search Direct" for the purpose of increasing ranking on Google; on the contrary, it is more inefficient than Google Search Direct as it extends the process and reduces the number of visitors clicking on the search result per unit of time.</li>
                            <li><strong>Referrer Spoof Navigation:</strong> Accesses the target URL with referrer information. (e.g., "https://www.facebook.com/"). This is for Analytics manipulation; it does not actually go to the referrer site, but tells traffic analyzers like Analytics that it came to this site from the referrer site.</li>

                                </br>Function: Opens the page, loads resources (images/css), and simulates mouse movements to appear as an organic visitor.
                                </br>Wait Time: Spends a random amount of time between 3 and 8 seconds after the page loads.
                                </br>Average Total Duration: Page load time + ~5.5 seconds.</li>
                            <li><strong>Surfing (Simple):</strong> 
                                </br>Function: Performs random Scroll, Engage (Mouse/Focus), and Idle actions in a dynamic loop on the page.
                                </br>Duration Target: A total duration target is randomly determined in the code between 10 and 20 seconds.
                                </br>Average Total Duration: Page load time + ~15 seconds.</li>
                            <li><strong>Surfing (Advanced):</strong>
                                </br>Function: Follows a 9-step scenario containing much more complex and human-like behaviors: Wait & Jitter, Focus on Headings/Texts, Wait Again, Scroll, Focus Again, Focus on Form Elements if any, Scroll and Jitter Combination, Click Internal Links (Navigation), Scroll and Wait on New Page.
                                </br>Duration: The sum of all these steps (excluding navigation and loading) takes approximately 40-60 seconds.
                                </br>Average Total Duration: Page load times + ~50 seconds.</li>
                            <li><strong>Cookie Generator:</strong> 
                                </br>Function: Clicks on random links within the same domain and navigates purely for the purpose of collecting cookies.
                                </br>Page Count (Steps): Navigates a random number of pages between 8 and 12 (Average 10 pages).
                                </br>Average Total Duration: (10 Pages x Load Time) + (10 Pages x ~3.5 Seconds Wait) = 35 seconds + Total Load Times.
                                </br>Note: Cookies exported with this module are not sufficient for the success of Google Search and Google Search Direct (these two modules used for SERP manipulation can only be successful with cookies taken from a real browser), but they may be used on various platforms like Youtube, Twitter, etc.</li>

                            <li><strong>Restore on Failure:</strong> Used cookie files are moved to a folder named 'processed' automatically created inside the folder specified as the import folder.
